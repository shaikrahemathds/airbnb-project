                    - **üè† Room Type Dominance**: Entire home/apt is the most dominant room type across various property types, often leading to higher average prices. This suggests that guests are willing to pay a premium for privacy and exclusive access to entire properties.
                    - **üè° Property Type Influence**: Barns and Camper/RV properties, when offered as entire homes/apartments, stand out with significantly higher average prices. This could be due to unique experiences, luxurious conversions, or high demand for these specific property types.

                    - **üõèÔ∏è Private Room Variation**: Private rooms within different property types show a wide range of prices. This variation could be influenced by factors like room size, amenities, and location within the property.

                    ### üìä **Trend Summary**:

                    Upon comparing the availability patterns for various property types across different time frames (30, 60, 90, and 365 days), the following common trend emerges:

                    ### üåü **Unique and Niche Properties**:
                    Properties like **Train**, **Castle**, **Houseboat**, **Heritage Hotels**, **Earth House**, and **Tree House** show **higher availability** across all categories. 
                    - **Reasons for Higher Availability**:
                    - **Premium Price** üíµ: These properties often come with a higher price tag, making them less affordable for long-term stays.
                    - **Tourist Appeal** üåç: These unique properties cater more to short-term, tourist-focused stays rather than long-term tenants. Tourists are willing to pay a premium for a unique experience.

                    ### üèôÔ∏è **Economical Properties**:
                    On the other hand, more **affordable** properties like **Apartments** and **Condominiums** exhibit **lower availability**.
                    - **Reasons for Lower Availability**:
                    - **Lower Price** üí≤: These properties are in higher demand due to their affordability, making them quickly occupied.
                    - **Convenience for Long-Term Stays** üè†: Apartments and condominiums are more suitable for people looking for long-term accommodation. The combination of affordability and convenience results in these properties having fewer vacancies.

                    ### üîÑ **Conclusion**:

                    - **Premium Properties**: Higher availability due to high cost and tourist-focused nature. Great for short-term stays and unique experiences.
                    - **Economical Properties**: Lower availability as they are often chosen for long-term stays, driven by price and convenience.

                    ---

                    This insight can be helpful for property owners and real estate professionals in understanding booking patterns and making strategic decisions about pricing, marketing, and targeting the right audience.

                    ‚ú® **Suggestions**:
                    - **For Unique Properties**: Focus on attracting tourists and consider pricing strategies that reflect the premium nature of these properties.
                    - **For Economical Properties**: Emphasize affordability and long-term stay convenience to ensure higher occupancy rates.

                    ### **Additional Fee Insights:**

                    1. **No Impact on Rating**:  
                    The additional fee (security deposit + cleaning fee) does not significantly affect the ratings of listings. Ratings tend to remain relatively constant across listings, regardless of the additional fees charged. This indicates that guests may not perceive a direct relationship between the cost of extra fees and the overall satisfaction or rating of their stay.

                    2. **Country-Specific Trends**:  
                    Countries like **Hong Kong**, **Brazil**, and **China** tend to charge higher additional fees when compared to other countries in the dataset. This could be due to several factors:
                    - **Regulatory Factors**: In some regions, stricter cleaning standards or insurance requirements may lead to higher fees.
                    - **Operational Costs**: Higher service and maintenance costs in these regions could drive up the fees, especially for cleaning and damage protection.
                    - **Cultural and Market Differences**: In some markets, guests may expect more frequent cleaning or higher-quality service, which could be reflected in the additional charges.

                    3. **Trend with Premium Amenities**:  
                    As seen in the **Average Price** analysis, properties with **premium amenities** (such as alfresco showers, chef‚Äôs kitchens, home theatres) tend to charge higher additional fees. This trend is consistent in both the average price and additional fee analyses, where luxury features correlate with higher service costs (cleaning, maintenance, etc.).
