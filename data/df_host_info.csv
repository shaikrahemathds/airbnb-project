I'm an administrator and real state manager. I study photography.
I've always enjoyed showing Rio around and helping people take the most out of the city.
It has been seven years I share my love for Rio renting apartments for short period and helping my guests with hints on tourist spots.
I love cooking and It will be a pleasure to be able to help with information about restaurants, bars and gastronomy in general.
I love to make new friends and to know different cultures.
My husband Ricardo is  a chemical engeneer, a great companion, but not talkative as I'm.
Our daughter Alice is 8 years-old. She is into dancing classical ballet, jazz and loves to exchange experiences with people in general.
I look foward to having you at my place!

Adoro viajar, fazer novos amigos e conhecer diferentes culturas.
Se você ficar na minha casa também vai conhecer o meu marido Ricardo, que é engenheiro químico e meu grande parceiro na hospedagem, gente boa, mas não tão falante como eu. Nossa filha Alice tem 8 anos, dança ballet e jazz e  também adora conhecer novas pessoas e trocar experiências.

As a traveller my wish is to make you feel at home; drink your morning coffee while listening to the sound of Istanbul then take your map, jump into the street with friendly neighbourhood,  and enjoy the city with walking, exploring, watching, reading and hearing. I know how it is important to be able to feel the city you are visiting from my experiences. So if you are looking for a place where you really want to taste the chaos with harmony like a real Istanbuller you are very welcome to stay in my apartment.

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

The Wonderful City of Rio has so much to offer as I have learned from my own experience, from the traditional Samba during Carnival to the less-known Parque das Ruinas in Santa Teresa (all close by the apartment). We never stop living and learning, and whatever you are planning on doing in Rio de Janeiro, you will continue on this path with an open mind in Rio, and add an important chapter to your personal travel memoire, just by absorbing a few of the experiences Rio has on offer. I have travelled most of the world, and still come alive to the sounds of the different rhythms, love the extraordinary food, and the warmth of the local ""cariocas"". I would say my favorite film so far this year is Intouchables. The apartments that I have to offer are fully equipped, well located, and I will personally make sure you enjoy your stay, without invading your space. I live close by, and can be reached almost any time of day or night.

Acredito nessa cidade maravilhosa e as oportunidades que oferece no futuro - como certamente me passou nas ultimas duas décadas. A gente vive aprendendo, e para qualquer um de vocês planejando visitar Rio de Janeiro, eu diria para ficar com mente aberta, e você vai crescer como uma pessoa, absorvendo só um pouco da experiência Rio tem para lhe provar. Já viajei o mundo, e adoro o som dos ritmos diferentes, comida extraordinária e povo tão caloroso. Meu filme favorito no momento e os Intocáveis.

I grew up in the  the Mid-West and saw the beauty of living in California.  I was born in Venezuela and have always worked on both English and Spanish, and am able to teach both languages.  My dream was to have a home in Hawaii.  I've have spent the last few years traveling  between CA  and many of the Hawaiian Islands in search of the perfect home.  We are settling on the shores of this quaint village.  I am married with one 15 year old son, and one dog Max. I love to hike and the kings trail is close to this house. I love nature and there are wild goats over on Umi street. I love to watch movies and there is netflix at the house. I love geckos and there are brown and green ones at the house. I like deals and the Aloha Beach house is one! There is a king bed now in the master- everytime we go we make the house nicer! It's nicer than our house in California. The master bedroom downstairs is very large and has a queen bed and futon. House can accomodate large groups; I just have to charge extra due to utilities. We get lots of family groups!

This beach house has been a 30 year dream in the making!  It is always so incredible when you see your dreams come true with belief and hard work. Please come and share the  Fantastic Sunsets at  Makai Hideaway- The sunsets are phenomenal and the snorkeling / swimming hole is a two minute walk from the house. The beach is a 15 minute hike from the community center in Milolii. I just enjoyed Easter services with the local people and it was wonderful at the little yellow church in the village. It really is a special place set  near  the last hawaiian fishing village

Seja bem vindo!
Eu adoro conhecer novas pessoas, compartilhar ensinamentos e pontos de vista. 
Amo a natureza, respirar um puro ar e me sentir conectada a energia da terra.
Me sinto muito feliz em receber convidados simpáticos que desejam experimentar ótimos momentos no Rio e desfrutar das alegrias e belezas deste lugar que eu tanto amo.
Botafogo é um bairro  onde a vida histórica e contemporânea convivem com charme a harmonia. Rodeado por montanhas e ruas arborizadas, viver em  Botafogo tem custo mais baixo que os outros bairros da zona sul, aqui é repleto de restaurantes, bares, feiras, museus e eventos culturais que acontecem com muita frequência, o bairro fica a poucos minutos do centro do Rio e dos principais pontos turísticos. A vila onde a casa está localizada foi construída há quase 100 anos, tem muitas árvores que recebem a visita de adoráveis animais da Mata Atlântica.
  A poucos minutos de caminhada  você encontrará a ""Praia de Botafogo"" que compõem uma das vistas mais incríveis do Rio, se preferir pegue o caminho oposto e dê um pulinho na Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas, de lá aproveite pra curtir o por do sol no Arpoador.
  Durante muito anos o Rio de Janeiro foi a capital do Brasil, então imagine passear entre as centenárias ruas de paralelepípedos do Centro do Rio, rodeado por prédios memoráveis de  belíssima arquitetura do século 19. 
  O bairro da Urca, onde abriga o bondinho do Pão de Açúcar, está a menos de 15 minutos de ônibus ou táxi.
  O Cristo Redentor  pode ser visto da janela  e você pode chegar a subida do Morro do Corcovado em apenas 15 minutos de ônibus ou táxi.
 Será um prazer compartilhar todas as dicas e lugares especiais que conheci ao longo dos meus anos de vida nesta cidade maravilhosa.

Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has reopened on Septemb (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) However due to the Government shut down limited areas within the main Park are accessible. Still very much worth the visit.  The Kahuku Units remains open.

After three months of eruptions in lower Puna punctuated by a damaging wildfire that burned nearly 3,800 acres of forest on Mauna Loa and Hurricane Lane lashing the Island with heavy rains and strong winds at the end of August the Island of Hawaii is in recovery mode and regaining normalcy.  AND we have a new Black Sand Beach at Pohoiki which IS accessible.

The USGS and Hawaiian Volcano Observatory are reporting that sulfur dioxide emissions at Kilauea summit and in the Lower East Rift Zone in Puna, where lava flows were occurring, have fallen drastically since the start of August and are at their lowest combined level in more than a decade.

Kilauea's latest eruption began May 3 with lava flowing continuously until Aug. 6. The affected Puna area, in the southeast corner of the island comprises one percent of the island of Hawaii, which is larger than all of the other Hawaiian Islands combined.  We are in Upper Puna and were not affected by the flow.
Visit Hawaii Volcanoes National Park   OR  USGS Kilauea for future updates.

KAEO is an enthusiastic gardener,occasional travel agent, sometimes Hula Girl, Hawaii born, ambassador to the culture, caregiver, former Ad exec and sometimes 'pretty good cook'.  She has lived on Oahu, Maui and now the ""best""-Island of Hawaii.  I've hiked hundreds on miles on ALL the islands, in past days:  Mauna Loa, Waimanu, Polipoli, Waihee, Wailau, Hauula, the Koolaus & Wainae Mountains.  A kayak trip to Kalalau circumvented the difficult 10.8m hike.  KARL is a master tile setter and works on all phases of the Carpentry, Remodel & Building Industry.  He built Eco Hale; we estimate using at least 60% re-purposed materials.  He also built our home in Mountain View and worked with his family numerous times on the Mainland and Hawaii to build their homes.  He is a Huge sports fan (Raiders in particular).  Karl comes from a family that simply needs their toothbrush when someone announces ""Road Trip""; hence thousands of miles visiting U.S. parks, cities and sights.  Our romance began on the island of Maui and our adventure, commitment and curiosity to/for one another continues.
We love the entrepreneurial, independent alternative lifestyle and very much enjoy sharing our slice of paradise in the rain forest.  Our lives have been enriched by the many guests from around the world who enjoy privacy and nature.

Sou carioca, apaixonado pelas cidades do Rio de Janeiro e de Florianópolis. Sou amante de viagens, e gosto de andar de moto e fazer Snowboard. 

O projeto do Jurerê Loft nasceu de muitas idas à Ilha da Magia, e decidi que precisava de um bom motivo para voltar mais vezes. Decidi investir nos apartamentos assim que os vi. O Alex me apresentou cada um dos 4, me apaixonei e pensei: Porquê não transformar esses lofts em uma experiência mágica para os hóspedes do mundo todo? Até hoje o Alex me ajuda com a gestão do Airbnb e a cada comentário elogiando o local e nosso atendimento, me sinto de fato realizado.

Tudo que temos aprendido nesse tempo de Airbnb tem nos ensinado muito, e espero sempre oferecer uma excelente experiência na estadia dos nossos hóspedes!

Estou sempre disponível para dúvidas sobre qualquer uma das cidades, dicas e sugestões (Sempre bem vindas).

Um Grande Abraço!

Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

Its ideal location in North Kihei is close to restaurants, many beaches, and interesting activities. From your lanai, you will see an ancient Hawaiian fish pond where green sea turtles sometimes come to bask; there is a quiet, shaded park, the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary (the only sanctuary dedicated to to humpback whales), and an awesome Indian restaurant right on the ocean. Located near the beginning of the longest uninterrupted white sand beach in the whole state, you can run (or walk) from our unit all the way (six miles -in front of Kihei Canoe Club, Maui Canoe Club and a few condos to the protected area along the Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge and board walk) to Maalaea Harbor (with the excellent Maui Ocean Center, Maui Golf & Sports park for the kids, many restaurants, Pacific Whale Foundation - and a bus stop to deliver you back in front of Kihei Bay Surf. Our complex has a good swimming pool, hot jacuzzi, tennis courts, BBQ area, and clean laundry facilities. 

Our corner unit is bigger and has more light than most of the other units in our complex. The wrap-around lanai offers more space than the other units as well. It has a queen bed and a sofa couch for sleeping. The unit has been renovated and upgraded several times since my mom first lived there when she arrived on Maui from Chicago in 1985 to teach English at Maui College. She loved her job and Kihei -- and she met a nice, handsome counsellor working at the college. They got married - and had me. 

And I just got married in August to my beautiful bride, who has a 8-year-old son. We feel very blessed. And we hope to share our love of place with you. 

At KBS, you will be close to Kihei Canoe Club, where both my mom and I have done competitive outrigger canoe paddling. You can experience being out on the water if you go to the KCC Visitor Paddle on Tuesday or Thursday morning. Get there by 7:15 am to make sure you get a spot. During the winter, you may see whales while you are on the water. Allow a couple of hours for the experience. My mom is a volunteer for the HIHWNMS - the free museum and whale sanctuary across the street. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, you can hear a free lecture from 11am until noon about the Humpback Whales. The museum is open from 10am-3pm, Monday-Friday, and on the last Saturday of the month from 10am-1pm. The mission is to educate the public and protect humpback whales and other marine life and our environment. 

Another activity that is nearby is Hawaiian singing, ukulele, and hula on Thursday nights from 7-8:30 pm. at the Keolahou Church, 177 S. Kihei Rd. It is joyful - and a glimpse of Hawaiian culture.

I try to become a friend to my guests, helping them to take the best of my wonderful city with safety and comfort. I speak fluent English, Spanish, Portuguese (of course), but I also understand German and other Latin-based languages. I have a young mind, love outdoors activity, bike, running at the beach, but also reading, music (from rock to opera) and travel. I'm quite easygoing, sociable and talkative. Hope to see you soon in Rio!

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

I used to live on the island of Oahu with my US Navy family when I was young.  We later moved to Southern California.  I knew one day I would return to Hawaii, the place I fell in love with long ago. I took a leap of faith and purchased my Maui condo June 2002 this was the beginning of fulfilling her prophecy to once again return to Hawaii soil.

I am a tropical expression artist who paints on canvas and etched metal.  My work is inspired by the beauty of the islands and has been displayed in several Maui art galleries over the years.  I am a writer and have my first book on Amazon.  I recently took up hula dancing and love to immerse myself in the culture and grace of this island.

Booking tip: I encourage you to book asap if the days in calendar are open or as soon as I reply to you. I don't know how the guest part system works. But I've had people who send inquiries to whom I've sent pre-approved responses. This doesn't mean anything until you actually book (make the payment). During this time I can still pre-approve other people and even other guests can go ahead of you and our previous conversations and book! They will actually get the booking.

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

16651655,8096835,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/8096835,Steven,"St Peters, New South Wales, Australia","Inveterate traveller who has spent a great proportion of my life on the road benefiting from the kindness of strangers - hitched, trekked, bicycled, motorcycled and trained independently to all sorts of far flung and unpronounceable points of the globe. Sometimes for years at a stretch. Extreme tourist as defined by Wikipedia. In between times a performer and photographer and occasionally all of the above simultaneously as photojournalist or touring actor.
I like to think I can tell great stories but I may be wrong...

During my idle hours I enjoy backpacking through universities collecting degrees and living a full life of adventure, discovery and art so if your interests and/or qualifications run to theatre, literature, fine arts, art history or the law then you've a ready partner for intellectual discussion.
A well stocked library is assured for convenient reference.

As you can probably tell I'm more than just a little bit xenophilic, enjoying the company of travellers, creative spirits and those just enjoying the freedom and discovery of the road.

My home is a sprawling quirkily evolving eclectic canvas; part tropical greenhouse and jungle, part improvisation workshop, part art studio, all of a slightly anarchic constantly changing composition. (I would never consider shopping at Ikea or watching any TV program involving adversarial reality and/or bogan house make overs, although I'm always enthralled and inspired by Kevin McCloud and Grand Designs.)

My place is a patchwork of sprawling, overgrown alternative comfortable anarchy.
If you insist on lovely suburban tidy townness, neatly trimmed herbaceous borders, minimalist generic and tediously `nice` hotel decor, or twee boutique pensions this may not be the place for you, but then again you probably should be reconsidering staying in and about Newtown on that criteria.
Our fantastically artistic and creative surrounds are one of the funkiest hubs of Australia, a rare inner city island resounding with alternative anti-gentrification energy and and sans bourgeoisie vitality - we live here because we love the community and our home is emblematic of that.
The vast majority of those who chose to stay with us seem to love it that way.

History of the Location of the apartment: 

The main thoroughfare is İstiklâl Caddesi, running into the neighbourhood from Taksim Square, a pedestrianised 300meter of shops, cafés, patisseries, restaurants, pubs, wine houses and clubs, as well as bookshops, theatres, cinemas and art galleries. Some of İstiklâl has a 19th century metropolitan character, and the avenue is lined with Neoclassical and Art Nouveau buildings.[citation needed] The nostalgic tram which runs on İstiklal Avenue, between Taksim Square and Tünel, was also re-installed in the early 1990s with the aim of reviving the historic atmosphere of the district. 
Some of the city's historic pubs and winehouses are located in the areas around İstiklal Avenue in Beyoğlu. The 19th century Çiçek Pasajı (literally Flower Passage in Turkish, or Cité de Péra in French, opened in 1876) on İstiklal Avenue can be described as a miniature version of the famous Galleria in Milan, Italy, and has rows of historic pubs, winehouses and restaurants",within an hour,100.0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/5025972/profile_pic/1416934198/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,False,True,False,3,"email, phone, facebook, reviews"

The people and culture here are unlike any other. I love it, especially here in Waikiki. There is always something new going on, which is why I love living here. I started bartending and quickly got to know a lot of the insurance and outs of Oahu. My career has brought me so much joy, and introduced me to some of the best people on Earth. It  has blessed me so much, and  I am very thankful to be here making an impact on people's lives. Now I am Food and Beverage Manager for a 5 star Resort.

For fun besides traveling, I enjoy practicing Capoeira (Brazilian martial art) , dancing, working out, speaking Japanese, reading, showing people a good time, relaxing on the beach, and of course hiking!

Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

Poker was a mix of hobby and profession, it came to me by fun, playing online but, started to met people in the real world, and
writing for magazines and websites. During 8 years I had an weekly column in J magazine, what ended with an invitation to cooperate with BetClick for the Poker section in their Portuguese branch office. 
To handle my Poker consulting business, I founded ""Coisas do Poker"" (""Things about Poker). 
But, my real passion is interior design and receive people.
Until now, I only practiced in in-house projects, for personal needs, in the different appartments where I lived.
For eight years, I lived in Luxembourg, where I worked in the headquarters of the European Community Parliament, revising texts for the Portuguese publications.
After a short return to Portugal, I went to Brazil for one year, this time, just for fun, where I lived in Araras and Rio de Janeiro.
Now I've embraced, somehow, professional projects in these areas, like this WBwGG"" (White Basement with Green Garden"", the ""Caramba!"" and the ""WHwTG"" (White House with Tasca Gourmet).
The ""Caramba!"" is an, already running, project with my friend Marina where we convert old fashioned furniture, and objects, into cool stuff.
Most of my parent's furniture will be the guinea pig and, once transformed, will be exposed in hot spots in the city but, also, in the house, where guests can see and even use.
The ""WHwTG"" is on his half way to launch, it's also a guest house but in the countryside, in Póvoa da Raínha, a very small place on the way to Serra da Estrela.
This is my grandparent's house, a typical old stone house of the Portuguese countryside, which I've adapted to be comfortable but keeping the original trace.
The purpose here is, not only, receive guests but, also, open the ""tasca gourmet"" to serve, and sell, regional food and beverage and promote tasting events.
With luck, the project in Póvoa da Raínha can be extended for the family lands that will face the water mirror of the future Girabolhos dam, under construction and, expected to be finished in one, or two years.

Here is a little of myself, what I've been doing and future projects but, here, may main goal is to have the chance to receive, the best possible, everyone who decides to visit us; that will be an enormous pleasure!

After studying and working in the entertainment industry in Los Angeles, I moved back to further my dance studies (I'm an Argentine Tango performer). I'm pretty free spirited and try to enjoy all the perks of living in Inwood! I love to hike difficult trails and like buying clothes to hike in -- although I might like buying the clothes more than hiking sometimes!   : )

I'm a huge fan of Inwood Park. It's not like Central Park at all (not that CP is bad but Inwood Park wasn't man-made). There are fewer people and it's a great place to be alone and think.  You can go to the weekly farmers market which is across the street every Saturday morning and then go on a morning hike, play tennis, basketball or soccer before finally laying out to work on your tan. Later you can watch the sunset over the Hudson River or perhaps go on a sunset hike. It really is nice up here! Come see what I see!! 

I also co-run THRIFTAHOLICS com & NYC GRINDHOUSE com with my boyfriend Michael. If you like thrifting, or want to do things in NYC cheaply, or even for FREE when you get here, you should definitely check out our site. We can get you very cheap tickets to Broadway shows!

My name is Enrique and I am a Barcelona Local. I have always loved traveling myself, but also sharing the beauty and wonders of Barcelona with others, so a few years ago I started renting out 2 apartments to travelers coming to the city, always meeting everyone in person so I could share my insights and hidden secrets about Barcelona :)

Now I rent out a few more apartments and it is no longer just me, but we are a small team of people managing the apartments together, but with the same focus on personal and attentive services in authentic apartments that allow for the genuine Barcelona feel for your trip! We call our little team Stay U-nique, because of this focus on a unique feeling when staying with us.

I'm Sarah, french girl living in Montreal since 3 years!
I'm a graphic designer working in an Architecture agency.
For sure I love travelling and have the time of my life each time I discover new things, new cultures, new people... 
What I love the most in traveling is to get lost, and appropriate the place. My ultimate dream is to live on a boat, dive and observe fish all day long. 
I'm also crazy about local gastronomy, I love discover a country/city by eating all kind of food that I see. 

Most of the time I travel with my boyfriend Pierre-Luc, he is a designer, he creates all kind of things,with metal & wood furniture, he is so brillant. 
Our latest crazy move was to restore an old loft in one of the best Montreal's district. We created all the furniture by ourselves.

I enjoy meeting people from all over the world & have lived & traveled in Europe, South America & went to Japan this year. 

I enjoy helping people find the things they want to do & see in our community & on our island. I love having my finger on the pulse of what's happening & if I can't answer your question right away, I can find out the answer quickly! I love connecting people with other people & helping in whatever way I can. I enjoy people from diverse backgrounds with interesting stories to share.

I speak Italian & German (although they are a bit rusty!) & I lived in both Italy & Germany, so I understand the challenges of traveling in another country & do what I can to ease things. I also speak a small amount of Spanish & French (can read it better than I speak!). I'm currently trying to learn a bit of Japanese (just getting started!) & have also studied a bit of Farsi!

My favorite things are Partner Dancing (Social Dance), such as Ballroom, Salsa, Swing & Argentine Tango. I love traveling & hope to one day see the Taj Mahal, Istanbul, Bali, Tahiti, Cordoba, Grenada, Malta, Vietnam, Thailand... well... I love to travel! I enjoy good wine & fine chocolate. I love sunsets at the beach... sunset is my favorite time of day & I try to see it each day. Surprising fact? I like old cars.

Uncles, aunts and cousins doing God's work all over the world, people not principally interested in money. Not to say that I do not approve of wealth and power. My grandfather, after all, was a wealthy man, founding a watch company more than 100 years ago, but let your good fortune be applied for a good purpose. 

Religion, however, is too confusing for me to understand, so I stick to nature. This is my guide in life. And it has worked very well for me so far. For these reasons, science, culture, politics. social justice, economics and all the things that make this world go round are of great interest to me. I'm green politically, blue in many ways, my eyes, my jeans, my bathroom towels, my mood once in a while, blue is good, I feel fine. Red and black attracts me, but generally, I will try to keep a cool head. White is beautiful, but what or who is spotless? Yellow and orange are great, who does not like sunshine? But I prefer gold. And silver would be my blue. It suites me better. I'll tell you more at a later point. 

Blond originally, but most hair that remains on my body is in all other places than on my head. I shave off the rest, with some stubble remaining once in a while when I'm just too lazy. I am a mountain person, strong, agile, in good shape. Style? Always appropriate for the occasion. Quality is what matters. And who does not recognize that, oh well, simply does not recognize it.

We enjoy the experience because staying at a vacation rental gives one a sense of the character of the city and people you are visiting -- something you don't get from the ""sterility"" of the hotel stay.  In that light, we are proud to be able to offer our guests an opportunity to stay in an apartment that is typical of the sort built after the war to accomodate the returning service men and their families.  The neighborhood is very much residential and varied in population age wise and linguistically.  It is only a block away from a major commerical artery and very close to the metro system.

 About myself, I am a biologist who now works in education at a College in downtown montreal.  While I am very much anchored in the scientific mind set, my reading pleasure invariably centers around history -- mostly western civilization -- and art.   We enjoy living in Montreal because of its cultural richness, and benefit from all the opportunites ranging from theatre productions to museum exhibits, etc.  We also enjoy hiking through the Laurentians and the richness of the environment that surrounds Montreal, which is not that far away.

Whether you come to stay here or not, I think you will enjoy visiting this unique city in the North America.  Montreal is sure to satisfy you at many levels, and we wish you a pleasant stay.

The main goal of our management is twofold:

- Provide the owner a full service under which you can forget about the worries and concerns the operation of holiday rental, knowing that the investment in the business will bring greater benefits than the option of ""traditional"" rent.
- Get the highest customer satisfaction, ensuring their comfort, in order to make your stay in our apartments result in all the most pleasant time possible.

I've been lucky enough to have traveled and lived all around the world, and am always ready for my next adventure to a new place.  I love cooking, baking, eating food in general, hiking and outdoor adventuring and enjoying the unlimited and varied activities that New York has to offer. 

From my travels, I know that where you stay makes a big impact on your overall trip experience, and even how you view the city. Because of this, I aim to provide guests with a comfortable and relaxing stay with easy access to all the city's offerings, in hopes that you will enjoy your time in New York City as much as I do.  I am happy to help you navigate the city, figure out what to do and how to get there, and provide any other assistance I can offer.  I love hosting people (I hope to eventually open my own B&B), and meeting people from all around the world.  My roommates are amazing people that share the same outlook.

I embarked on a full renovation with my builder and later employer Michael Wagstaffe which included building another level on top where I now live.

I   have installed double glazing and acoustic flooring to make my guests stay as comfortable as possible.

22586401,2349948,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/2349948,Hawaii Dream Realty TEAM,"Honolulu, Hawaii, United States","ALOHA and WELCOME to Waikiki, Honolulu on Oahu!  Thank you for your interest in one of our vacation rentals.  We are a TEAM of professionals who manage individually owned condo apartments for the owners when they aren't using them within several different condo / hotel buildings in Waikiki.   We offer a range of accommodations types from small studio apartments (with or without kitchenettes) to 2 bedroom residences with full kitchens.  

We want your stay to be an enjoyable one and finding the right match for you is key.  As a general guideline, there are many different types of buildings and hotel-type of arrangements.  For those doing Hawaii on a budget, studios offer the best of both worlds providing a clean, private place to stay within walking distance to the BEACH at affordable prices (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities).   For those looking for nicer or larger accommodations, then you should target $150/night off season to $250/night peak season (vary for upgrades, views, cooking abilities, building amenities, parking included).  If you are looking for an Ocean-front experience, then target $350- $400/night and for a luxury experience, $500 to over $1000/night.  Hawaii offers something for everyone at every price point!  

Our vacation rental units are privately owned and managed.  We offer an alternative to the hotel experience allowing our guests to “live like a local” in paradise whether be for a few days, a few weeks or a few months.  Our units are well maintained, repaired when necessary and treated routinely with pest control services.  We try not to interrupt our guests during their stay, and if the unexpected happens, we do our best to resolve it quickly with the least inconvenience to our guests.   Upon arrival, we try to meet all our guests personally to register, check-in, and answer any questions.  And if you’re running late don’t worry, we can make arrangements no matter the hour and register you in the office the next day.  

Stop by our real estate office, ground floor of Kuhio Village.  We are there daily to assist and share this incredibly beautiful island, local eateries, activities and entertainment found in Waikiki and around the island.  We look forward to hosting you in one of our vacation rental units and helping to make your stay a fantastic one.  A hui hou (until we meet again)!

Oporto Rental Management was created in 2015 by the wishes of four young friends: Rosa, Tania, Igor and Nuno. The ORM was born of the combination of the main passions of its founders: the city of Porto and its cultural characteristics; the architecture and decoration; the gastronomy and photography and, above all, the contact with different cultures.

The project is based on the support and guidance of property owners located in the center of the city who want to direct their homes to the tourism market.

It also involves the design and decoration of these same spaces, giving them a unique identity that translates into the extremely positive reaction of our guests.
Our project culminates in the total management of the property, which includes the organization and preparation of these spaces for the tourist rental.
So with our dedication and daily work we have been able to please our guests who show the highest intention of repeating their experiences with our team. 
In addition, besides the management, we are responsible for the constant guests' contact and that we privelege the personalized accompaniment - what distinguishes us and allows us a greater proximity to the diverse cultures.

Quatro amigos, muitos sonhos, um caminho em comum

Oporto Rental Management surgiu em 2015 pela vontade de quatro jovens amigos: a Rosa, a Tânia, o Igor e o Nuno. A ORM nasce da combinação das principais paixões dos seus fundadores: a cidade do Porto e as suas características culturais; a arquitetura e decoração; a gastronomia e fotografia e, acima de tudo, o contacto com diversas culturas. 

O projeto baseia-se no apoio e orientação de proprietários de imóveis localizados no centro da cidade que pretendam direcionar as suas casas para o mercado do turismo.
Envolve ainda a conceção e decoração destes mesmos espaços, conferindo-lhes desta forma, uma identidade única que se traduz na reação extremamente positiva dos nossos hóspedes. 
O nosso projeto culmina na gestão total do imóvel, que inclui a organização e a preparação destes espaços para o arrendamento turístico. 
Assim, com a nossa dedicação e trabalho diários temos vindo a conseguir conquistar todos quantos nos visitam e que demonstram a maior intenção de repetir as suas experiências com a nossa equipa. 
Acrescentamos ainda que além da gestão somos responsáveis pelo contacto constante com os nossos hóspedes e que prezamos o acompanhamento personalizado - o que nos distingue e nos permite uma maior proximidade com as diversas culturas.

After several experiences with AirBnB, i realized that not only is this the new way to travel, but it is also an excellent opportunity to network with different people from all over the world! I love travelling, and the prospect of meeting new people from around the world makes AirBnB an awesome experience for myself and my roommates.

One of my best trips so far was a roadtrip across the United States. I have made this trip twice and it's amazing to see how peoples' lives vary across the country. We met many travellers along the way through AirBnB, which really inspired me to set up something similar in my own home.

Most recently, I travelled to the United Kingdom as an exchange student and during the weekends, I backpacked around Europe. My experience here was completely different from my previous travels in the United States and in Asia. It really provided me a different view of the world, not simply the North American view, and this has allowed me to communicate better with people who don't speak fluent English. Most importantly, there is an instant bond/connection that is made when I meet someone who is either from a city I have travelled to, or has been there as well! 

I hope to hear about where you are from, and some of the places you have visited, to help give myself a better idea of where I want to travel to next!

Comecei a hospedar profissionalmente a pouco tempo, mas tenho certa experiencia, pois hospedei em minha casa, muitos amigos e familiares ao longo dos 20 anos que resido no Rio de Janeiro.
Sou gaúcha, nasci do RS e mudei para a cidade maravilhosa a 20 anos. Amo minha terra, meu sul, mas me apaixonei perdidamente pelo RJ. Cheguei aqui muito novinha, decidi ficar, trabalhei bastante para isso e consegui! lembro me que assim que cheguei, por mais que eu trabalhasse e não tivesse muito tempo para diversõe, estava sempre com a impressão de que estava de férias, acredito que pela proximidade do mar e pela descontração dos cariocas.
Estudei, me formei aqui ( Direito), e toda a minha vida construi nesta cidade. Sempre gostei de hospedar e hoje, fazendo isso profissionalmente posso dizer que é sempre um prazer, adoro idéias e culturas diferentes. Tambem sou uma viajante, sempre que posso tento conhecer novos lugares, minha última viagem  foi a Turquia, uma viagem inteiramente inusitada, mas que adorei. Por esse motivo tento me colocar no lugar do hospede, procuro dar boas dicas de diversão e locais interessantes na cidade maravilhosa.
E por falar em cidade maravilhosa, essa realmente é uma cidade maravilhosa, temos belezas naturais, gente bonita, temos a descontração e a simpatia do povo carioca e adoramos receber turistas que, normalmente se encantam e retornam diversas vezes ao RJ.
Bom, tento ser pontual ( não esquecendo que estamos no RJ e as vezes o transito nos castiga bastante), cumpro com o prometido, sou uma pessoa correta, prezo a palavra  e gosto que sejam assim comigo tambem.

Hey,

I have been on Airbnb since (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) , when I started renting a small room in my house, where I was able to receive people from all around the world and share with them my passion for Rio.

The success was so great that after time, my friends and friends of friends, 
 came to ask me to manage their listings. I accept the challenge, and the number of apartments was multiplying ... I left the University of Geography and decided to dedicate myself exclusively to my guests ! It was the best decision I ever made.

After some years I founded my own agency, Omar do Rio (Omar from Rio), specialized in Vacation Rentals and today I manage innumerable seasonal apartments in the city. I realized myself by being able to work with an activity that I love so much, that added so much to my life.

My goal today, with my agency, is to provide a safe, quiet and quality stay, so that my guests can enjoy the experience in the Marvelous City.

Count on me and my Team to get all the support and best tips you can have in town.

See you in Rio!

Omar

I've been living and working part of each year in Australia, part in Tokyo, and little working trips all over the place.

I write a Magazine column in Japanese, 'Cecilia's Permacutlure Slow Life'. Its about creative ways to de-trap your life of wasted time, energy and affection, freeing you up to do the good work you were put on this world to do. 

For more than 10 years I've run a share-house for creative people - you can read about it on my blog Balcony Garden Dreaming.

My hobbies are Japanese tea ceremony, creative dinner gatherings and drawing illustrations of the quirky world I dream to live in, and often actually do.  

I've been a WWOOF host for many years, hosting travellers who volunteer their talents to help look after this house, garden and all its creatures.  

I don't have a life motto exactly, but when thing go wrong, I ask myself 'Whiner or Designer?'.  That gets me positive and resourceful.  If things go wrong for you I won't say it though. I'll just help where I can xx

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

Wow!  'Ohana Nui owes it all to the 1000+ great guests over the last 8 years that have come with a fun fresh and positive outlook on their travel and vacation.  Thank you everyone for making 'Ohana Nui what it is.

Aloha!  We are Brendan and family, and we enjoy sharing our beautiful three story home, 'Ohana Nui, with respectful travelers from around the world.   Brendan, single father of 2, is retired from construction (early) to be a full time dad, world traveler, and Airbnb Host.  He loves to ""talk story"" and Stand Up Paddle Surf.  The kids, though not here all the time, are two well-behaved, respectful children (ages 11 and 12) who love meeting all the ""Uncles and Aunties"" in the house.

Our newest addition to the team, Colin, is a career driven full time student, and now co-host that takes care of many of the day to day aspects of Ohana Nui and Ohana Nui Motors in Brendan's absence.  What more can we say about him, Colin is Awesome!

We keep our home smoke-free and drug-free.  We also keep everything clean and tidy.  We do not have a party house by any means, just a nice place to relax and make new friends.  

The name of our home, 'Ohana Nui, means Big Family, which is what we aspire to be to our guests.  Our family is as rich and diverse as the colors of our flag and we show aloha to all.  We strive to provide everyone with all the comforts of home; with safety, quality, and affordability; and to provide every guest with a great local feeling and local experience, all the while, just outside of Waikiki.

Then, FEELPORTO passes through the common interest of the larger community of those who inhabit the city, also in the heart.
And because Oporto is part of the heart of the north of this country, its community expands through and beyond its borders. Therefore, this project is open to all interested in approaching this sense, promoting their ideas and interests on a regular basis.
This way, it can provide all visitors experiences and emotions parallel to the usual and special itineraries. I propose, therefore, that are also the unconditional city lovers, from north to south of Portugal and beyond, to be a part of this community FEELPORTO ... Because Port is Beautiful.

Surrounded by wild beauty, turquoise waters, bright sunshine, friendly towns, pristine beaches, epic sunsets, gleaming waterfalls, warm water, lush mountain ranges, and the sound of tropical breezes rustling through the palm trees, how could we not?
Matt and I have been married for almost 13 years and have two sons:  Ryker, who is at the very fun, adventurous age of 4, and Finn who is at the loveable age of 2.5. We also have high hopes to add more kiddos sometime in the future.  
A little about us:  we LOVE Hawaii.  The beach is our favorite playground; building sandcastles with the boys, surfing, cruising on our SUP boards, joy-riding waves to shore, exploring the underwater world with mask and snorkel, kayaking, hiking- we just can’t get enough.

In its multiplicity of angles, this experienced and intimate city vibrates in secret places, landscapes, stories and events. Who lives there or passes by, feel it deeply.
Then, FEELPORTO passes through the common interest of the larger community of those who inhabit the city, also in the heart.
And because Oporto is part of the heart of the north of this country, its community expands through and beyond its borders. Therefore, this project is open to all interested in approaching this sense, promoting their ideas and interests on a regular basis.
This way, it can provide all visitors experiences and emotions parallel to the usual and special itineraries. I propose, therefore, that are also the unconditional city lovers, from north to south of Portugal and beyond, to be a part of this community FEELPORTO ... Because Port is Beautiful.

I love the outdoors and especially cycling up to the Christ statue or in the hills above Silicon Valley.  I am very familiar with the musical scene of Rio and can be your guide or give you the information you need.

I am a native English speaker and speak fluent Portuguese and passable Japanese.  I also can make myself understood in Spanish.

My philosophy as a host:  My parents were very successful small business owners with a carnation farm and later a flower shop. They had their business listed in the best of Silicon Valley and even had local TV coverage.  Out of hundreds of similar businesses, they were able to differentiate themselves on how they treated and interacted with their customers.  They worked hard to give that little extra that made people want to come back.  My goal as a host is to treat as you my parents would have.  Let me show my definition of hospitality.  

Moro entre o Rio de Janeiro e nos suburbos de San Francisco, em Califórnia. Sou um DJ de rádio educativo com um programa de Música Brasileira para os últimos 30 anos.

Hi,大家好我是Visnon. 

我们喜欢旅行,爱住当地的老房子,逛当地的市场,喜欢色彩浓郁的国度,探索奇葩的民风! 

我们改造了一些老房子,并加入了有趣的想法｡ 
在分享前我们都会试住几天,确保一切安好,并在细节上做更人性化的调整｡ 

因为是老房子,它有温度又有些局限,希望能体谅它｡Visnon坚持选用五星酒店出身的专业管理团队来打理房间,使用星级酒店的床品,希望我的每个客人都能感受到放心和舒适｡ 

快来香港找我们玩吧! 
Visnon会在能力范围内Do my best for you!

A little about me...I've recently rediscovered my love for pinball. I love dining-out and love a coursed meal for special occasions.  My favorite city is Chicago, but Brooklyn has won me over too.  I'm a new Crossfit fan - can't wait to finally be able to do a pull-up  :)  I've been a teacher, a bartender, a counselor, and now I work in TV when I'm not hosting.  I love meeting new people over a well-made campari cocktail.

FAQ: When do I pay for my long-term reservation?
www.airbnb.com/help/question/245

Due to the reason that Sep-Apr is peak season, you are advised to make your reservation earlier.   I can only do first book first serve basis, where I won't cancel current booking just because other guests have a longer / bigger booking.  Due to strict cancellation policy, I haven't cancel guest booking so far, except from time to time having guest need to cancel or amend their booking due to different reason and we will considerate case by case (so far only full refund to 1 group of guest as they are able to provide document to proof that their immediate family member need emergency operation). 

Max Capacity is cater to big group consists of family n kids with standard asian size.  If group with members with huge body size or some members prefer to have a bed by their own, not sharing with other, then please split your group into two apartments for more comfortable stay.  I have tried my best to write the apartment description as detail as I could. Please spend time to read through before you book.  I am definitely happy to answer any question that is not in the apartment description.


Contact Number and Email Information will only be released until a booking is made.

While I tend to be easy-going, I do have my pet-peeves. For example, a shoes-free home means just that. With that said, I ask that you please review the house ""rules"" before you book with me.

Either as a host or a guest, I'd be up for hanging out some time. I like to meet new people and explore the city together. If you'd like to hang out during your visit, then let me know in advance. My work schedule is pretty unpredictable and I often do work from home. I can get pretty busy, but if you give me some advance notice I'll make sure we have time to spend together. Otherwise, I generally assume that guests want independence.

If you prefer to do your own thing, then that's totally fine too. Don't worry I won't be offended. I can certainly appreciate that you may have a pretty full itinerary when you come to NYC.

I'm a former journalist, PR guy and worked for a non-profit in the sustainable agriculture / environmental field for many years. I started my own coaching/consulting business a few years ago and would be interested to find out more about what's going on in your life. Perhaps I can help you out in some way?

My guests have included a combination of tourists and business travelers. Whichever category you fall under, you're welcome to stay with me. I have an extra room and I'd be happy to provide you with an opportunity to step into the shoes of a New York City resident for a while. Who knows? Maybe you'll like the East Village so much that you'll want to find your own apartment and never want to leave.

I host singles and couples, but you should note that there is an added fee of $30 per night for all additional guests over one person.

The most common things I hear from guests are:

""The room is so much bigger than I thought based on the photos in your listing,""

""This is a really cool room/place!""

""I love the natural light that comes into this room!""

""It's such a comfy atmosphere in here that I really hate to leave!""

Guests really love the location! location! location!

On the flip side, I sometimes hear people remark that walking up five flights is ""telling them that they need to get into better shape.""

If nothing else, I hope that you'll find your visit with me to be enlightening (that's a joke because the bedroom is well-lit and I am a life coach ;)

Every summer, me and my family used to go travelling through Europe on a caravan. Recently I upgraded to a campervan as it is a more sustainable option and is easier to drive and park. I love the freedom it provides for a touring holiday or escaping into Nature and my mission is to share this experience with fellow travellers. 

Our campervans provide freedom on wheels. So guests can travel with no restrictions and no ties. With no need to book hotels, no arrival schedules to limit you, no pre-paid programs to follow. It is about total freedom of choice and use to explore or relax.

You can get closer to Nature. Fall asleep under the starry sky, wake up in the middle of the mountains, have breakfast by the sea. The perfect companion for outdoor activities surrounded by Nature. Pick up your gear and go explore!

We are locals with a passion for travel and gastronomy keen on giving advice and proud of their travel library! We can suggest travel itineraries. We are specially keen on the North of Portugal region as its varied landscapes, heritage and people make it a fabulous destination that all travellers love!

Looking forward to providing you with the adventure of a lifetime!

3800450,10716263,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/10716263,Carolina,"Wainiha, Hawaii, United States","Hello Airbnb Community, 

My name is Carolina and I am... a little bit.... gypsy. I love to travel, to learn new cultures, study languages and people, get to know new people and new ways of living. I am currently living in Hawaii, studying to be a midwife, working as a doula (Angels who help sister deliver babies) and managing a few projects in Rio. So although I visit Rio for 3 months a year, Im based in Hawaii and also get to travel around the globe. 

 I can say I am a people's person and love to make people feel good, from hosting to cooking, to massage, thru teaching yoga... etc. I just love to share the things that make me passionate about life in this world. 

That's why I love to talk about Brazil, travel around Brazil and to share the features of this amazing country I am proud to be from. Brazil is my home and Rio is my heart. I am born and raised in Rio, and have experienced this city in a lot of different ways. Here I have been a Law student with long downtown areas and party scenes at night, I've been a nature seeker with long trail/nature hours and good sleep at night, I've been an artist with long days dancing and knowing the theatre/circus scene, I explored Rio as total tourist living in a hostel, and now I have been exploring it while working with education as a citizen and cultural productor. I grow up and its seems that Rio grows up with me. Its always different and better, everytime I come home.

When I travel, I like to feel like I am from there. I like to feel like I am doing what the locals do, feel that I am interacting with the place and its people in its fullest, and so I am a very open traveler. When I host, I like to understand peoples needs, a person who comes to Rio for a bussiness journey, will have different expectations of a person who is traveling for tourism. Or a person who is traveling with family, thinks different than someone who wants to enjoy the party scene in Rio, etc. So, I do love to hear from you, and I will do my best to accommodate your needs. 

Since I don't live full time in Brazil, and because together we can reach places we could never reach alone, I have lovely a co-host who helps me with this. Together we want to create unique ways for our guests to feel welcome.

That's why, we want to hear from you, your opinion is very important to us on this new journey. Our ideal is that the world can be only one, we are one and can live likewise, with love. A big community of people that altogether we can do beautiful things for ourselves, our community, our planet. We want to show love to people, and part of it, we will do by hosting you on the best way we can. 

What is your ideal? How can you feel home? What are things that could improve your experience in a new country? How do you like to meet people? What are your intentions with your trip? If you could choose something, anything, that would make your trip the most memorable, what would you envision? 

Love,

Carolina

Olá Comunidade Airbnb,

Meu nome é Carolina, e eu sou... um poquinho... ""cigana"". Eu amo viajar, conhecer culturas diferentes, estudar linguas e pessoas, entender e conhecer pessoas e novas formas de viver.

No momento, me encontro no Havai, estudando para ser Parteira, trabalhando como Doula (Anjinhas que ajudam mulheres a dar a luz.) e gerenciando alguns projetos no Rio. Eu moro no Rio metade do ano, uma outra parte no Havai e alguns meses consigo viajar, quando meus desejos sao realizados. 

Eu posso dizer que sou uma ""pessoa de pessoas"", porque gosto de fazer pessoas se sentirem bem. De hospedar, a cozinhar, massagens, professora de yoga, etc. Eu simplesmente amo dividir com pessoas todas as coisas lindas que me fazem ser apaixonada pela vida nesse mundo. 

Por isso eu amo falar sobre o Brasil, viajar pelo Brasil e poder dividir essas experiencias por esse pais maravilhoso, o qual tenho orgulho de ter nascido em. O Brasil é minha casa, e o Rio meu coração. Aqui ja vivi diversas fases e conheço cenas diferentes. Desde de uma estudante de Direito com longas horas pelo centro, e conhecendo as festas de noite, á uma naturalista com longas horas no mato e em trilhas e dormindo muito a noite, á artista com longas horas de dança, teatro e circo, já fui turista por completo morando em um hostel, e agora tenho explorado o Rio com projetos pessoais, trabalhando em educaçao e as vezes produtora cultural. Eu vou crescendo e parece que o Rio cresce comigo, é sempre diferente e melhor quando volto pra casa. 

Quando viajo, gosto de sentir que ""sou de lá"". Gosto de viver a cultura e interagir com os lugares e pessoas ao maximo. Por isso, sou uma viajante muito aberta a experiencias. Quando hospedo, gosto de entender as necessidades pessoais de cada um, uma pessoa que procura meu apartamento para uma viagem de negocios, tem expectativas diferentes de alguem que veio á turismo. Pessoas viajando com familia, tem planos diferentes daqueles que vieram a procura da festa perfeita ou etc. Logo, eu gosto de escutar voces, e entender as suas necessidades, vou fazer o meu melhor para acomoda-las. 

Como não moro constantemente no Brasil, e como juntos chegaremos aonde jamais conseguiriamos chegar sozinhos, conto com a ajuda da minha Co-Anfitria. Juntas  nos queremos que os nossos hospedes se sintam em casa, o maximo possivel, queremos inovar e trazer experiencias lindas e diferentes pros nossos hospedes.

Por isso, queremos escutar voces. A sua opiniao é muito importante pra a gente nessa nova jornada.  Nosso ideal é que o mundo é só um. Somos todos um, e podemos viver assim, com amor. Uma enorme comunidade de pessoas que juntos, podemos construir coisas linda pra nós, nossa comunidade e nosso planeta. Queremos distribuir amor para as pessoas, e parte disso fazemos quando hospedamos nossos hospedes da melhor maneira que podemos. 

Qual é o seu ideal? Como você se sente em casa? Que coisas poderiam melhorar a sua estadia em um pais diferente, ou em uma cidade? Como você gosta de conhecer pessoas novas? Quais são suas intenções nessa viagem? Se você pudesse idelizar alguma coisa, qualquer coisa, que faria sua viagem inesquecivel, qual seria sua visão?

Unlike other B&B owners I am suggesting per your choice VIP-tours, renting a house/room (Bed and Breakfast), renting cars, fishing, hunting, whale watching, etc. in one bundle.
 Basic price for each bedroom is $89-99/night (two people). You can rent one or up to four bedrooms or entire house.
Extra guests/children can sleep on couches for basic price $20/night/guest.
If you rent two bedrooms (or just one, but without other guests), you actually have in your possession entire floor. If it is one bedroom (Master Suite), usually it is first floor with gigantic hall and porch with Jacuzzi. If it is two bedrooms - usually it is second floor with living.
Shared areas are kitchen, dining room, big covered porch with grill, office on a second floor that you have to share with other guests (if they are here) and owners who live on premises.
If you are renting room/rooms for 7 days or more - you are eligible for 10% discount;
If you are renting entire house (4 bedrooms) - you are eligible for another 10% discount;
If you are renting for a month or more - you are eligible for another 10% discount.
Sure, if you choose a bundle, you save your $$, time and nervous. For more information, please, see (Website hidden by Airbnb) and (Website hidden by Airbnb) 
There is a German Shepherd dog on premises.
Bed and Breakfast becoming more and more popular in America due to more comfort, privacy for less cost.

英語が苦手､ﾀﾞﾒな方もご心配いりません､お気軽にご連絡下さい｡

ただ一つ､予約後はair bnbのｱﾌﾟﾘの更新をした上で操作の確認をすることを忘れないで下さい｡予約ﾍﾟｰｼﾞの閲覧の仕方が頻繁にｱｯﾌﾟｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞしています｡

空港から私のｱﾊﾟｰﾄまでの位置確認､下記参考にして下さい｡

•ｻﾞﾊﾞｽ(市ﾊﾞｽ)
$2ﾄﾞﾙ75ｾﾝﾄ､(十九､二十番)で乗り換え無し､約1時間でｱﾊﾟｰﾄに到着です｡
ﾊﾞｽ内にお釣りはないのでご自身で用意するのをお忘れなく｡
大きなｽｰﾂｹｰｽをお持ちの方は乗車出来ませんが､機内持ち込みｻｲｽﾞで来られる方はﾊﾞｽで来れたら格安です!ﾊﾞｽは寒いので上着必須｡

空港発ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ行き
(7:00-8:30に乗車の場合)
ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ前発 空港行き 
(15:30-18:00に乗車の場合)
途中通勤ﾗｯｼｭに巻き込まれるので確実に1時間以上はかかります｡私もこの時間は運転しないように気をつけています｡


空港発ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ行き降車地点
 ""Kuhio Ave and launiu street"" 
ｸﾋｵｱﾍﾞﾆｭｰ ｱﾝﾄﾞ ﾗｳﾆｳｽﾄﾘｰﾄ (ﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝ目の前)
運転手にﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝに行きたいと伝えたらｽﾑｰｽﾞです｡目の前のﾊﾞｽ停で降りて下さい｡

ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発空港行き
""Kuhio Ave and Launiu street""
同じくﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝの道を挟んだ向かいにﾊﾞｽ停が設置されています｡だいたいﾊﾞｽ停は登り､下り､道を挟んで対に設置してあります｡

ﾊﾞｽ停から歩いて30秒でｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発見､到着!ﾊﾞｽに乗り慣れていない方も一度試してみてはいかがでしょう~｡

ﾊﾞｽを降りてﾋﾟﾝｸの3､4階建の建物(個人的には一番の目印にしております)が見えたら､その角がﾗｳﾆｳ ｽﾄﾘｰﾄです｡必ず分かります｡
ﾊﾞｽ道を背に一軒先に行った左手にあるのがこの建物 414 launiu streetです｡

•ﾀｸｼｰ
荷物の積み下ろしやﾁｯﾌﾟだのでだいたい30分かかります｡ﾁｯﾌﾟ入れて$35-$40が目安でしょう｡

•ｼｬﾄﾙﾊﾞｽ
$17くらい｡
ﾜｲｷｷ行きはﾎﾃﾙで降りなければいけないことがおおいのでその際に､ﾎﾘﾃﾞｰｲﾝﾜｲｷｷｴｸｽﾌﾟﾚｽがｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞ的にも降りても差し支えなさそうなﾎﾃﾙ(個人的意見)｡3分くらいでｱﾊﾟｰﾄに着きます｡もしくはｺﾝﾄﾞﾃﾙのﾌｫｰﾊﾟﾄﾞﾙはｱﾊﾟｰﾄの真向かいなので､停まってくれるならとても便利)

•ｳｰﾊﾞｰ､ﾘﾌﾄ
$21からと記載されています｡(変わっている可能性あり)
ｱﾌﾟﾘにどこで拾ってもらうか記載してあるので必ずその位置へお進み下さい｡
空港にはﾙｰﾙがあり､その位置に行けない場合はお迎えは断られます｡",within an hour,100.0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/427ad931-54e9-418d-a76b-a2c0c28f754b.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,False,True,False,19,"email, phone, reviews"

4621926,8729599,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/8729599,Maria,"Montreal, Quebec, Canada","Hello! 

I´m a very active AirBnB user, both as a hostess and a guest, so that allows me to (try to) be a good guest and a good hostess.  

My job has the advantage that some days I work from home, and some days I travel for work. Even though I enjoy my home greatly, I really like the idea of spending time in other places, particularly if they are warmer! 

I have two dogs I love very much. Sadly for you, they are not included with the apartment... :) I take them with me everywhere I can so you may get to meet them if you host us. They behave even better than me, but they´re hairier. But then again, I clean after them constantly, so we´re the perfect team. You must know, I´m particularly clean. OK, fine, I´m a clean freak. But I suppose it´s a good quality for a hostess, let alone for a guest! 

I spend most of my time outdoors, whether it´s exploring new and old territories, or in my backyard, which I enjoy immensely. I try to make my home a comfortable, warm and cheery place, where I can concentrate on my work during the day and a good book in the evenings. And when I feel like people-watching, giving my stove a break or enjoying the hustle and bustle of the city, I just have to turn around the corner and voilà! Everything is within walking distance. 

I consider myself a lively person, but I need my peace and quiet at home. And I´m a light sleeper so I am looking to host guests who look for a quiet spot to recover after exploring the city. And as a guest, I look for quiet spots as well, as I usually travel for work and I need to sleep well before and after a long day. 

Airbnb is made up of very different individuals and places, therefore communication, consideration and courtesy are key, and I hope you will find that in me.

Happy travels, everyone.",within an hour,100.0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/8729599/profile_pic/1378839559/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,True,True,True,3,"email, phone, reviews, jumio, offline_government_id, government_id"

I lived in China, Thailand and Mexico for years and now living in my hometown Hong Kong. I enjoy every single moment travelling from one place to another. It's the best time for me to overlook the world and to empty my mind. It is said that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. We are on the southern hemisphere in the morning and appear on the northern in just some hours. The best way for me to feel home anywhere is to meet local people! I listen to their stories and learn their cultures, respect their traditions and share mine with them. This is what travelling means to me.

Thanks to Airbnb, it provides a platform for people to meet friends and look for accommodation at reasonable price. Star-rated hotels are great, but local hosts can give you warm welcome and make you feel home.

I have years of experience hosting foreign guests through couhcsrufnig (CS), but stopped hosting since 2 years ago. After I returned from Mexico to Hong Kong in 2014 to start this hotel business, I found that airbnb is one of the best platforms which combines couhcsrufnig and business into one.

My fave cafés and restaurants are in Newtown, Enmore, Leichhardt and Surry Hills! 

I love to travel to eat and shop. I have travelled around Europe staying with many ""Airbnb"" accommodation so understand the importance of being a good host. Plus I do genuinely enjoy giving advice to guests. It is also a very rewarding feeling when I hear my guests having a good time because of my advice. :)  However, my husband and I do lead incredibly busy lives and because we lead such busy lives, when we do have downtime, we love to have a chat with our guests, catch up for supper etc to wind-down. We have gained friends through hosting and I do believe that hosting is like ""hosting my friends that I haven't met yet!"" I treat all my guests like I would my longtime friends so I do hope my guests treat me back the same way by being polite and respectful of my house.

When I am a Guest at an Airbnb accommodation, I will always treat the house like it is my own and respect it. And when I am a Host, I will try to add a personal touch by personalising the experience to each individual that visits as I know each individual guest is different.

For instance I am able to listen loudly music whenever I would like, or I do not hear any other’s in here.  Lastly, at these days, I am planning to be a part of one art collective or collaborate with some young artists . If you like, you  can bring you ideas, creativity and art into my collaboration.

I am both a Super Host and traveller, so my places are designed for absolute comfort with discerning travellers like myself in mind!

As a long standing Australian Super host, I strive to offer fabulous, unique, sparkling clean accommodation in the vibrant Sydney suburb of Newtown just 3km from the CBD, walk to Sydney Uni and RPA Hospital.  I have been offering accommodation for 17 years, before Air BnB I was listed on more commercial sites.

My point of difference is I have a ABN and my business is run to a professional standard with correct insurances etc. There are no common shared spaces. You are not squeezing into someone else home! My places are your home away from home.

Having returned from travelling, 3 times to Santa Barbara in 2018, and in 2017  (kayaking in Antarctica and exploring Chile) and having worked in Geneva and NYC, I strive to offer guests what I need myself, a very comfortable bed, quality linen, quiet but interesting environment and a place to eat and work (a real table and chairs!), a couch, outdoor space and Wifi!

Much of my time is spent travelling  and hosting and I also have my own Clinical and teaching mental health practice so I am busy!

Here's my hosting story:

In 2000 I purpose built Studio Q as a stand alone Studio in my garden in O'Connor, a sought after leafy inner suburb with cafes a easy 10 min walk away.  The City is 3km away and ANU a 15 min walk.  This property has been sold but Simon is now hosting Studio Q.

In Newton (Sydney) I have 3 fantastic apartments in the same complex with a roof top garden.  3 mins to the train and on ""the strip"" of restaurants, cafes, bookshops, movie and live theatres.  Please read more under Newtown Mews listings.

You will find my favourite local tips in each unit (i.e. best local cafes, great walks and the best the area has to offer).  I am a non intrusive host, and available by phone or email between 9-7pm,  I do not offer a 24 hr Concerige service but reviews conclude I am helpful and available in reasonable hours.",within an hour,100.0,https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/7044418/profile_pic/1371880419/original.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,True,True,True,3,"email, phone, reviews, jumio, offline_government_id, government_id"

We knew each other in our early teens and remained friends into our 20s. In 2004 we ran into each other completely serendipitously and a few years later were married in our garden in Berkeley, surrounded by friends and family. We are both interested in art, architecture and music, where his tastes are classically inclined and mine tend more towards the Grateful Dead and lately, everything ukulele.  We love hiking, reading, traveling and good conversation.

My first trip to Kauai was in 1975 and it was love at first sight. Smitten, and haunted by memories of green and blue and rainbows and Bali Hai, I moved there in 1977, just in time for my twin daughters to be born at Wilcox Hospital in Lihue.  We ended up moving back to the mainland a year later, but in the intervening years, we vacationed there many times as a family. One of the twins eventually heeded the island's call and in 2012 moved to Princeville with her husband and family. (You could probably count on one hand the number of days they have not been at the beach or on a wave since moving!) I hope to persuade my city-loving husband to consider retiring to Kauai. So far he has promised me a month per year.  That's a start.

We hope your stay in Hale Nani or Hale Nani Iki is a pleasant one.

Welcome to Secret Falls Retreat in Kapaa, on the island of Kauai in Hawaii.

We are a permitted Homestay with the County of Kauai!:).

Use Permit No. U-2015-14
Class IV Zoning Permit Z-IV-2015-15

This property formerly called Mohala Ke Ola, has been running as a BnB for over 25 years. You will find it listed in the old Kauai guide books, we renamed it in 2011 when I purchased the property. You can really hear the water falls roar on a quiet night after the rainfall, and you can hike to the falls from the back deck. Hence, what a better name than Secret Falls Retreat!. 
We were closed for a while as we did many renovations and upgrades, but are up and running 100% now and look forward to hosting you and receiving new reviews soon!:).
 
I am origainlly from California, grew up in Northern British Columbia, Canada. 
I love the outdoors and am a workaholic, always busy! Tim was born and raised in Hawaii, so you have all the local inside information you need:). We have 3 children ages 8, 12 and 15 that attend a private and public school here on Kauai.  They help out with the BnB when time allows between their studies and extracurricular activities.  We enjoy the beach, hiking, horseback riding, paddle boarding, beach Volley Ball, fishing, and soccer. 
As we love music, we also own an event company called Hawaiian Muzik Factory, so we do weddings, anniverseries, baby parties, graduation parties ect. We also have large event tents, tables, sound systems, lights, and live bands.  Between the kids, the BnB and the Muzik Factory, it is a busy fun life in paradise! We look forward to meeting you!

Our property has a solar heated salt water pool and jacuzzi. Located right in the middle of the island, so you can go to north shore or south shore in 45 min to an hour either way.  No need to bounce accomadations to see the whole island! We live on the property and are available for assistance most of the time. Some of the best restaurants, beaches and shopping is only minutes away. Hiking trails on the Sleeping Giant are within walking distance. We offer a continental breakfast that varies depending on availability of local produce and fruits ect. We do not have breakfast on Sundays and Holidays as that is our family time:). We are a family run operation and look forward to hosting you:).

I think my place is the heart of the city. Im an English teacher who loves her job so much. I studied in England, lived there for seven years( considering its a long time)  I sometimes confuse my nationalty :)  I love music both listening and making. I play violin and guitar and besides Im a dance teacher too. I am a nature person who runs away to the mountains and lakes and camp there in her tiny spare time. I work busy hours because ı only work with business people.

My place is very central which is in a walking distance to all puplic transports and easy to get to and find. We have three bedroom in my big flat and ı sometimes I invite my students in the living room for lessons but very rarely. If you see people laughing around dont be surprised :) The building is not pretty new as nearly all flats are the same in Kadikoy area.  My neighbourhood is very safe and everybody knows eachother here and all of them are lovely people. I used to have a dog in the last years as you read in the rewievs but my friend  took her from me to a lovely farm where she is free and happy. House will be very clean when you checked in and I dont do a deep cleaning until you leave so try to be nice and tidy :) There are no rules in this house!!! I love people who treats this area as their own place. 

I have been hosting people on Airbnb for three years and had lovely friends and unforgetable experiences. Some of them stayed for a day and some of them stayed for three months bu we still keep in touch with most of them. I love meeting new people, listening different stories, learn abour their culture. Maybe Ill ask you to go out together if we have or play a game or even a long chat if you want ofcourse.

I'm quite active, I love ocean swimming, riding my motorbike, go hiking, skating or long walks to enjoy the outdoors. I go dancing from time to time (tango or salsa) and I channel a fair bit of energy through my creative outlet in photography. I love to travel, even though I haven't been to nearly as many places as i wished to, but each and every travel experience brings immense joy, learning and friendship that I value. 

I enjoy meeting people, I especially love spending time with those who are positive, easy going, adventurous, open minded and passionate in following their dreams.

And I love to travel.  Surf, snowboard, hiking and biking trips as much as possible.  I bought and remodeled the house in Hana for quick Maui staycations to surf and play in the rainforest hikes with family and friends, and the design of the home and cottage is to my type of lifestyle, indoor/outdoor living, comfortable furnishings, and ample room to prepare meals and relax.

Some of my favorite travel destinations are Canada and Colorado for the boarding, camping, hiking and biking, houseboat trips to Lake Powell, and, if time/money allow, the southwest of France for the surf, food, wine and culture.

My travel style has modified over the years.  It used to be budget all the way.  Those years are behind me, now I prefer a reasonable price, a clean place, with amenities, and convenience to the happening spots in the area, which is exactly what I want to provide for others in Hana as an Airbnb host.

It's a big world out there, set aside some time for yourself and explore!!

9444630,24293332,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/24293332,Kerem,Istanbul / TR.,"Greetings! Despite how unnatural it feels to try and ""describe"" a human being, especially one's own self, let's give it a shot. I'm an independent game developer, which is a fancy term for ""a human who's chosen not to earn as much money as he could be earning in order not to be told how to do things"". Having lived in almost every part of Istanbul (and therefore having seen its lowest as well as its highest) I found myself unable to move away from the Galata area and eventually settled here.

As a host, I'm doing Airbnb for the sake of meeting with new people and having an excuse for drinking more beer. Being into this sort of a thing solely for the purpose of having an extra income is, tho I respect that choice as well, just not for me. I'm more of a ""eh, let's be off with the fake pleasantries, fake smiles, fake impersonations and hit the damned pub!"" person, being much more into conversations and interactions where all sides are genuine and not parts of self-made scripts. 

There's something lovely about knowing that I've helped someone enjoy their trip more. It's not always easy getting a taste of the local life in Istanbul since authentic cities such as this are also usually hyper-touristy. What's more is that the understanding of a ""local life"" will differ from one part of the city to another, it's as non homogeneous as it gets and that's why I love helping my guests around - so that they can experience how we ""the Galata area people"" live.

ただ一つ､予約後はair bnbのｱﾌﾟﾘの更新をした上で操作の確認をすることを忘れないで下さい｡予約ﾍﾟｰｼﾞの閲覧の仕方が頻繁にｱｯﾌﾟｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞしています｡

空港から私のｱﾊﾟｰﾄまでの位置確認､下記参考にして下さい｡

•ｻﾞﾊﾞｽ(市ﾊﾞｽ)
$2ﾄﾞﾙ75ｾﾝﾄ､(十九､二十番)で乗り換え無し､約1時間でｱﾊﾟｰﾄに到着です｡
ﾊﾞｽ内にお釣りはないのでご自身で用意するのをお忘れなく｡
大きなｽｰﾂｹｰｽをお持ちの方は乗車出来ませんが､機内持ち込みｻｲｽﾞで来られる方はﾊﾞｽで来れたら格安です!ﾊﾞｽは寒いので上着必須｡

空港発ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ行き
(7:00-8:30に乗車の場合)
ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ前発 空港行き 
(15:30-18:00に乗車の場合)
途中通勤ﾗｯｼｭに巻き込まれるので確実に1時間以上はかかります｡私もこの時間は運転しないように気をつけています｡


空港発ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ行き降車地点
 ""Kuhio Ave and launiu street"" 
ｸﾋｵｱﾍﾞﾆｭｰ ｱﾝﾄﾞ ﾗｳﾆｳｽﾄﾘｰﾄ (ﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝ目の前)
運転手にﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝに行きたいと伝えたらｽﾑｰｽﾞです｡目の前のﾊﾞｽ停で降りて下さい｡

ｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発空港行き
""Kuhio Ave and Launiu street""
同じくﾘｯﾂｶｰﾙﾄﾝの道を挟んだ向かいにﾊﾞｽ停が設置されています｡だいたいﾊﾞｽ停は登り､下り､道を挟んで対に設置してあります｡

ﾊﾞｽ停から歩いて30秒でｱﾊﾟｰﾄ発見､到着!ﾊﾞｽに乗り慣れていない方も一度試してみてはいかがでしょう~｡

ﾊﾞｽを降りてﾋﾟﾝｸの3､4階建の建物(個人的には一番の目印にしております)が見えたら､その角がﾗｳﾆｳ ｽﾄﾘｰﾄです｡必ず分かります｡
ﾊﾞｽ道を背に一軒先に行った左手にあるのがこの建物 414 launiu streetです｡

•ﾀｸｼｰ
荷物の積み下ろしやﾁｯﾌﾟだのでだいたい30分かかります｡ﾁｯﾌﾟ入れて$35-$40が目安でしょう｡

•ｼｬﾄﾙﾊﾞｽ
$17くらい｡
ﾜｲｷｷ行きはﾎﾃﾙで降りなければいけないことがおおいのでその際に､ﾎﾘﾃﾞｰｲﾝﾜｲｷｷｴｸｽﾌﾟﾚｽがｸﾞﾚｰﾄﾞ的にも降りても差し支えなさそうなﾎﾃﾙ(個人的意見)｡3分くらいでｱﾊﾟｰﾄに着きます｡もしくはｺﾝﾄﾞﾃﾙのﾌｫｰﾊﾟﾄﾞﾙはｱﾊﾟｰﾄの真向かいなので､停まってくれるならとても便利)

•ｳｰﾊﾞｰ､ﾘﾌﾄ
$21からと記載されています｡(変わっている可能性あり)
ｱﾌﾟﾘにどこで拾ってもらうか記載してあるので必ずその位置へお進み下さい｡
